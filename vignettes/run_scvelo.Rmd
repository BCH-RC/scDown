# Define Universal Variables for scVelo Part I
Set up the environment for running scVelo Part I by defining key variables. 

Loading a Seurat object (seurat_obj) containing single-cell RNA-seq data is required. The cell type annotation column (annotation_column) is defined to specify the cell type or other annotation labels, ensuring the analysis runs with the correct group.

Spliced and unspliced mRNA counts of the scRNA-seq data are required for scVelo analysis. These counts can be obtained by generating .loom files using [velocyto](https://velocyto.org/velocyto.py/tutorial/index.html). The `loom_files` is required, except in rare cases where the spliced and unspliced data are already incoporated into the Seurat object. 

To integrate spliced and unspliced mRNA counts from .loom files with the Seurat object, users need to specify `loom_file_subset_column` to indicate the metadata column in the seurat object that matches with the file names of input .loom files (the default is "orig.ident"). For multiple loom files, the file names in `loom_files` must correspond to the values in the specified metadata column of the Seurat object.

By default, `loom_file_subset_by` is left blank, as it will automatically be extracted from .loom file names in the same order as input `loom_files`. If needed, users may specify a character vector for `loom_file_subset_by` to subset the Seurat object while ensuring that the order of `loom_file_subset_by` matches the order of file names in `loom_files`. 

The mode for scVelo velocity calculation can be one of four options: "steady_state" (original), "deterministic", "stochastic" (fastest: recommended, default), "dynamical". 

The working directory `output_dir` by default is the current directory and can be changed to specific path. 


```{r, message = FALSE}
# Set the working directory
output_dir="/lab-share/RC-Data-Science-e2/Public/Qianyi/test_pipeline/scdown/scDown/"
setwd(output_dir)

# Seurat object
seurat_obj <- readRDS("inst/extdata/DentateGyrus/10X43_1_spliced_unspliced.rds")
# specify which Metadata column of the Seurat object should be used as cell type annotation
annotation_column <- "clusters"

# file names for input .loom files containing spliced and unspliced counts of scRNA-seq data
# e.g., loom_files=c("/path/to/directory/WT.loom", "/path/to/directory/KO.loom") 
loom_files=NULL
# specify the metadata column in the Seurat object that matches with the file names of input loom_files
loom_file_subset_column="orig.ident"
# this will automatically be extracted from file names of input loom_files 
loom_file_subset_by=NULL

# mode for scVelo velocity calculation
mode='stochastic'

# the number of grids along each axis, controlling the number of vectors on umap
grid_resolutions=c(50)
# velocity vector size (arrow head size)
arrow_sizes=c(0.5,1)
# velocity vector size (vector width)
vector_widths=0.5

# colors to be used in plotting
color_scale=NULL
# specify which metadata column of the Seurat object is the color scale named by
name_by=NULL

```

# Run scVelo Part I
The spliced and unspliced matrices from .loom files are added as new assays to seurat_obj, which is converted to .5had file. The .5had file with spliced and unspliced matrices will be used as input for scVelo Part II run_scvelo_full(). 

## Run scVelo for entire data
We estimate RNA velocity for entire data using spliced and unspliced counts of scRNA-seq data using scVelo and visualize the vector field. 

```{r}
start_time <- proc.time()

# Run scVelo Part I
run_scvelo(seurat_obj = seurat_obj,
           output_dir = output_dir,
           annotation_column = annotation_column)

end_time <- proc.time()
elapsed_time <- end_time - start_time

# Print the elapsed time
print(elapsed_time)

```
```{r}
# elapsed_time: 2 min
```
This plot visualizes the vector field on UMAP embeddings using different arrow head sizes and widths. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianyima/Documents/Manuscript/12.6.2024_vignettes/plot/R_wrapper/velocityField__gridRes50_arrowSize0.5_width0.5.png")

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianyima/Documents/Manuscript/12.6.2024_vignettes/plot/R_wrapper/velocityField__gridRes50_arrowSize1_width0.5.png")

```



## Run scVelo for specific time points
If specific groups of time points are provided, we subset the Seurat object for each group of time points, and then compute velocity using scVelo and visualize. 

```{r}
# subset a group of time points used to calculate RNA velocity
time_point=list(12,35)
# specify which metadata column of the Seurat object should be used for time_point subset
time_point_column="age.days."

# Run scVelo Part I
run_scvelo(seurat_obj = seurat_obj,
           output_dir = output_dir,
           annotation_column = annotation_column,
           time_point=time_point,
           time_point_column=time_point_column)

```

This plot visualizes the vector field on UMAP embeddings for each time point group. 

```{r}
# time point: day 12 
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianyima/Documents/Manuscript/12.6.2024_vignettes/plot/R_wrapper/velocityField_12_gridRes50_arrowSize0.5_width0.5.png")

```
```{r}
# time point: day 35 
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianyima/Documents/Manuscript/12.6.2024_vignettes/plot/R_wrapper/velocityField_35_gridRes50_arrowSize0.5_width0.5.png")

```

# Summary

This document outlines a pipeline for incorporating spliced and unspliced RNA matrices from .loom files into Seurat object, and analyzing RNA velocity using velciraptor, a R wrapper for scVelo. The pipeline begins by defining key variables, such as the working directory, Seurat object, species, and metadata for cell type annotations and preparing for input .h5ad file for the run_scvelo_full() pipeline. It runs scVelo on the entire dataset to compute RNA velocity across all cells and generates generates visualizations for Velocity vector field on UMAPs.

Additionally, the pipeline supports focused analysis by selecting specific time points  (e.g., age groups 12 and 35) or comparing user-defined groups. For each group of time points, the Seurat object is subsetted and velocity is computed. 

This pipeline provides a comprehensive tool for incorporating spliced and unspliced matrices from .loom and computing RNA velocity.
